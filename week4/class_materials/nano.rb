story = "One figure spotted another crossing the bridge. The latter swiveled head in every direction, searching for anyone paying attention. The former was comfortable in the knowledge that no attention was being paid to it. The latter figure finally spots the former. The latter looked exactly where it was told to look, and after a moment finally spotted the former. Latter started to call out, stopped herself, started to wave, fought the impulse, has a dozen more half-formed movements propagated through her brain and body. If anyone had been watching, they would have been paying attention now. After thirty more of the most chalant steps ever attempted by humanity, she reached the figure. She tried to make out the dim figure in the alcove. It was only six feet in front of her, but the moon was facing the wrong direction. Former stared back at her. They shared an expectant moment. Latter realized. She looked to the night sky, trying to remember.
	'Crap.' said Latter.
	'Okay.' said the alcove.
	'No, I mean I don't--'
	'Okay.' There was a rustle and a muffled clink in the dark, as though the alcove was pulling something metal out of a pocket.
	'No, but--what if I'm a spy?'
	There was a small pause that could indicate either mild amusement or intense loathing.
	'Are you a spy?' 
	'No!'
	'Okay.'
	'What if I was?'
	'Then you wouldn't walk like that.'
	'What if I was a clever spy?'
	'Then you wouldn't forget the password after being told three times.'
	'The meetings are supposed to be anonymous!'
	'Then walk anonymously.'
	Latter ran out of words. There was another pause as the alcove waited to see if anything else was forthcoming, then she began to reach for her pocket again.
	'Drainage Basin!'
	There was another pause from the alcove. The password hung between buildings like a clothesline.
	Bright orange light flared for a moment and briefly illuminated both figures.
	The figure in the alcove wouldn't strike you as the kind of figure to be standing in a dark alcove late at night, waiting for someone to say 'drainage basin!' at her. She would strike you much more as the kind of figure to partner in a a small business selling fancy useless things to fancy useless people, in whose advertising the term 'artisinal' would figure heavily.
	Former wouldn't strike you. She had a chubby, guileless face that you would naturally trusted not to hurt you, at least not intentionally.
	The match was extinguished and the alcove was now a moving orange dot and the smell of smoke. Former waited, but there was no movement from the alcove other than the dot.
	'Well?'
	The dot was silent. When it finally spoke, the dot had a much softer voice.
	'Look, honey--'
	The dot searched for the right words.
	'I think you might be in a little over your head.'
	'I can do it! They said I could do it! Don't you trust them?'
	'Trust who?'
	'The people at the mee--'
	'No. Not the people at the meeting. Because the meeting didn't take place, remember? Just like this conversation? And the transportation of the object in my pocket? 
	'Oh.'
	'I think it would be best for everyone if you just went for a late night stroll for no particular reason and then returned home, with nothing in your pockets and no delivery to make. The next time you're at a place where certain people certainly are not, they can completely fail to ask you to complete a task to which you are better suited.
	'Oh.'
	'Alright?'
	'Yeah. Okay.'
	The dot fell to the ground and disappeared. The alcove spoke, much more harshly.
	'Scram.'
	Former slowly turned away and back to the main road. Keeping her head and feet down, she walked with such quiet, inward-facing disappointment that when the alcove looked at her again, it barely recognized her.

	day 2
	There was a bridge. Primarily constructed from basalt quarried 15 kilometers to this location, cut by masons and stuck together with high quality mortar. A city contract, with all its problems and rewards. Went to the lowest bidder, of course, but a decent quality build nonetheless. The bridge can withstand its own weight, of course, and then another three quarters of that on top of it. Not the best ratio for a bridge, but decent enough for the traffic that would be going on it. A this moment, several things were affecting the bridge. For one, the temperature was ten degrees centigrade, which caused some mild contraction. Basalt
