1. How does Ruby read files?
Ruby can read files via the file.gets method used with a loop, or with iterators such as IO#each_line or IO.foreach.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
I would use the following code:
File.open("output.txt", "w") do |file|
  file.puts "Hello World!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
The Dir class creates directory streams representing directories in the underlying file system. It is used to create, query, filter or remove directories.

An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a make-like build tool written in Ruby. It is used for job automation: to specify tasks, describe dependencies and group tasks in a namespace. A rake task can be one of the built-in types or a block of my own Ruby code.
