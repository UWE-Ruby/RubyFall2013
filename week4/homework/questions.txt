5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

Rake is Ruby make. It is for writing automation scripts and making dependecies, as well as grouping together like-tasks, kind of like you would with a module. A rank task is merely the set of commands Ruby uses to do those things I just mentioned.
