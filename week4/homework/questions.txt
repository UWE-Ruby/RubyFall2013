5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a build tool, written in Ruby. It is used to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace. A rake task will have associated actions (possibly more than one) and a list of prerequisites. When invoked, a task will first ensure that all of its prerequisites have an opportunity to run and then it will execute its own actions.
