1. How does Ruby read files?
	Ruby reads files with an File object, a subclass of the IO class.  A new instance
	of File creates a bidirectional channel between Ruby and the external resource.  

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
	File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
		file.puts "Hello World!"
	end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
	The Dir class provides Ruby with access to streams related to the underlying file
	system.  It has a number of methods that allow Ruby to interface with command line
	functions like mkdir, pwd, and chdir (changes the current working directory).
	
4. What is an IO object?
	An IO object is a bidirectional channel between between Ruby and an external resource.
	That basically comes directly from the book, so source = pickaxe book page 153.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
	Rake is a build language, a domain specific language for task management, similar to
	make, but written in Ruby.  Rake defines two types of tasks.  Normal tasks are 
	named, defined and have dependencies declared.  File tasks are file tasks.
