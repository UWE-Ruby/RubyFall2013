1. How does Ruby read files?

You can read a file by creating an instance of a File object. The first parameter is the filename, and the second is the mode you want to open the file with.

  f = File.new("filename", "mode")
  f.close

You can also open a file with a block. 

  File.open('name', 'mode') do |f|
    while line = f.gets
  end




2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

Open the file in writing mode. Then use puts to append the text. Make sure to close the file after you're done using it.

  f = File.new("my_output.txt", "w")
  f.puts "Hello World!"
  f.close

You can also use a block.

  File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |f| 
    f.puts "Hello World!"
  end




3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

The Dir class represents the underlying filesystem. You can do things like checking if files exist, enumerating direcotry contents, and creating new directories.




4. What is an IO object?

IO is a base class for input and output (reading and writing) operations. File is a frequently used subclass of IO.




5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

Rake is ruby's version of make. 

You specify tasks that will run regular ruby code. These tasks can have dependencies, requiring other tasks to be run beforehand. With this, you can setup automated processes like testing.

Rails seems to use this for database operations. db:drop db:create db:migrate, etc.
