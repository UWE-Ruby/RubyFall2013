1. How does Ruby read files?

Ruby defines a single base class called IO. This class is used to handle reading files in addition
to writing files.  IO is subclassed by classes File and BasicSocket. To read a file in Ruby, you'll
read from an IO stream. To open the stream, you could invoke File.open with the filename and the file
mode string of 'r'.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

hello.rb
File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do | myfile |
  myfile.puts "Hello World!"
end

ruby hello.rb

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

The directory class is 'Dir'. Objects of class Dir are directory streams representing directories in
the underlying file system. They provide a variety of ways to list directories and their contents. There
are a number of methods that can be used to make and delete directories, change to a directory, or open
a directory to read its content.

4. What is an IO object?

An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

Rake is a simple Ruby build program similar to make.  It is an internal DLS or Domain Specific Language
using Ruby.  It is used to manage software tasks.  It allows you to specify tasks and describe dependencies.
It also allows you to group tasks in a namespace.

A task is made up of a chunk of Ruby code.  It begins with the keyword "task" and is followed by a symbol
which represents the name of the task.  That is followed by a list of pre-requisite task(s) and a do/end
block of Ruby code.  There are two types of tasks; regular and file.  A task performs a specific function
in the build process.
