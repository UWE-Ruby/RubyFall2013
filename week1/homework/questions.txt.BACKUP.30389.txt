1. What is an object? Everything in Ruby is an object. Specifically in Ruby it is synonymous with class instance.

2. What is a variable? A variable is something that holds data. They hold a reference to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class? The class is the category. The object is the class instance.
Every object is generated from a class.

4. What is a String? Any text surrounded by single or double quotes, or, to put another way, sequences of characters
between delimiters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods Are you just looking for string
methods? .index, .reverse, .upcase, .downcase, .swapcase, .split and many more.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two? Text between single quotes
and text between double quotes. Uh, the quotes. Ruby does more work with the double quotes, such as looking for things that 
start with a \, and expression interpolation.

1. What is an object?
An object is a representation in memory of a specific concept or thing that the Ruby interpreter knows about. 

2. What is a variable?
A variable is a name for a location in memory. It can contain, or point to, any type of object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is an instance of a class, or a specific thing of that class's type in memory. The class is the specifics that are common to all things of that type. The classification of a concept or a thing is a class. A specific thing or concept of a class's type in memory is an object. For example: All books have titles (Class). This book's title is "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (Object). 

4. What is a String?
A string is how Ruby understands text. It is a collection of characters (Bytes), and can be created by making an instance of the String class (String.new) or as a string literal ("",'', %Q[]).

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp! - removes newline characters, or the specified characters, from the end of a string
strip! - removes leading or trailing whitespace from a string
split  - returns an array of strings made up of the original string separated on whitespace or the specified characters or regexp

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Single quotes ex: '' and Double quotes ex: "". The single quotes allow for 2 escape characters: \' and \\ . The double quoted string literal allows for many different escaped special characters (like \n is a line break) and allows for string interpolation, or the injection of evaluated Ruby code into the string ex: "Hello #{my_name}". The single quoted string takes up much less memory than a double quoted string with interpolation. Without interpolation, both are about the same.
