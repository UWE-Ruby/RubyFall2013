1. What is an object?

An object is anything "we manipulate in Ruby." This would not, for example, include variables, because a variable is merely a reference to an object.

2. What is a variable?

A variable is a reference to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

A class is an object, but an object is not necessarily a class. Any class is an object of the class Class, and like any object it will inherit relevant class properties. However unlike a class a non-class object will not contain methods or reference a superclass.

4. What is a String?

Strings are sequences of characters. They are objects of class String.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

chomp, split, count

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?

You can define a string literal by wrapped text in either single quotes or double quotes. The difference between the two is that a double quoted string can support more escape sequences.
