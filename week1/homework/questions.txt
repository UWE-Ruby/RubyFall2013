1. What is an object?
1a. An object is an instance of a class.

2. What is a variable?
2a. A variable is used to keep track of an object -- it is a reference to an object. 

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
3a. An object is an instance of a class; a class is simply a combination 
of a state and methods that use that state. For example, a class may be a song, 
and an object would be a specific song. All songs have the same actions that 
can be applied to them -- i.e. they can all be played, recorded, deleted. 

4. What is a String?
4a. A string is a sequence of characters -- normally holding printable characters, but not necessarily so. They can also
contain binary data. Strings are objects of the class String. 

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
5a. One can split a string into items by specific characters (.split), 
trimming strings of repeated characters (.squeeze!), or similarly to split, using
.scan to specify the pattern of character chunks to match before dividing the 
string into said chunks. 

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
6a. String literals can be defined using single-quotes or double-quotes, the 
difference between which are the escape sequences that are supported in each 
case.
