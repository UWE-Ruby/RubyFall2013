1. What is an object?
Everything appears to Ruby as an object. 
Everything that you can manipulate in Ruby is an object, 
and the results of those manipulations are themselves objects.

2. What is a variable?

A variable is a reference to an object. 
Variables are an object's attributes that become properties of objects once an object is created, and
are used to keep track of objects. 
                   
3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Classes are a combination of state and methods that are used to represent an object. Everything
that you manipulate in Ruby is an object and objects are initialized as instances of classes.

4. What is a String?
A string is a mutable object in Ruby that holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes
of data.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp, split, scan

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Using %q and %Q (Q is optional) delimiters and by using 'here documents.'  
Characters following the %q or %Q are delimiters. The string is read unitl the next occurrence of th delimiter.
[, {, ( or < or followed by their matching close symbol: ],} ) or >.
'Here documents' constist of lines in the source up to but not including the terminating string that you 
specify after the << characters.
