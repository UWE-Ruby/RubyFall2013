Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
A instance or 'thing' of any type that is defined in memory within the context of the program

2. What is a variable?
A name that is given to a specific object

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is a specific instance of a class.  A class may have specific attributes that are themselves objects of another class.

4. What is a String?
A string is one or more characters.  A string object is an object that is a member of the string class.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
length (return length of string)
index (return first character location of a hit on asubstring or regex pattern)
encode (convert character encoding)

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
single (') and double (") quotes...
single quotes don't interpolate variables and only require escaping the single-quote(') or backslash(\)
double quotes allow variable interpolation and have many more 'special' characters that either require escaping or that can be created through the use of backslash(\)
