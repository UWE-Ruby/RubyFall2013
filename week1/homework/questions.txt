1. What is an object?

   Objects are instances of the class.  Objects have a state (attributes), behavior (methods), and identity (unique identifier).  Objects are instances that have identical methods but differing data.

2. What is a variable?

   Variables are used to keep track of objects.  Each variable holds a reference to an object.  Ruby supports four types of variables: Global Variables, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Local Variables 

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

   Objects contain information about something in the program. Objects provide actions (functions and methods) which manipulate that information.

   Classes contains the blue print of how to build an object and information about what defines an object.

   For example, recipe for a blueberry pie.  Recipe is the class and blueberry pie is the object.

4. What is a String?

   Strings are objects of class String.  Stings are simply sequence of characters and are created using string literals - sequences of characters between delimiters.  Strings can also hold binary data.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
   1. %q (single-quote)
   2. %Q (double-quote)

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?

   Double-quoted stings allow substitution and backlash notation but single-quoted strings don't allow substitution and allow backlash notation only for \\ and \'.
