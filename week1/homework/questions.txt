p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
<<<<<<< HEAD
a instance of a class. 

2. What is a variable?
a reference to a object

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
a class is a combination of state and methods. an object is a instance of that class ( class instance ).  


4. What is a String?
A sequence of characters.  

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp, count, delete, empty? , length, upcase, downcase, split, squeeze! ... woah there are alot. 


6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?

single or double quotation marks. 

single quotes 'foo', foo becomes the value. 
For Double quotes, "foo\nbar" ruby looks for substitutions, interpolation "#{foo}" and escape sequences "Foo \nBar"

also %q ( single quotes ), %Q ( double quotes ) 

%q/foo bar/
%Q!oh no #{crap}!

you can choose a delimiter. 

Finally here documents. 

string = << HERE
	some kinda text 
	about something
	i forgot what
HERE

=======
An object is a representation in memory of a specific concept or thing that the Ruby interpreter knows about. 

2. What is a variable?
A variable is a name for a location in memory. It can contain, or point to, any type of object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is an instance of a class, or a specific thing of that class's type in memory. The class is the specifics that are common to all things of that type. The classification of a concept or a thing is a class. A specific thing or concept of a class's type in memory is an object. For example: All books have titles (Class). This book's title is "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (Object). 

4. What is a String?
A string is how Ruby understands text. It is a collection of characters (Bytes), and can be created by making an instance of the String class (String.new) or as a string literal ("",'', %Q[]).

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp! - removes newline characters, or the specified characters, from the end of a string
strip! - removes leading or trailing whitespace from a string
split  - returns an array of strings made up of the original string separated on whitespace or the specified characters or regexp

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Single quotes ex: '' and Double quotes ex: "". The single quotes allow for 2 escape characters: \' and \\ . The double quoted string literal allows for many different escaped special characters (like \n is a line break) and allows for string interpolation, or the injection of evaluated Ruby code into the string ex: "Hello #{my_name}". The single quoted string takes up much less memory than a double quoted string with interpolation. Without interpolation, both are about the same.
