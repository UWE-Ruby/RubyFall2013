Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
  In Ruby, everything you manipulate and the results of those manipulations is an object.

2. What is a variable?
  Variables keep track of objects by holding a referance to that object. They are the container in which values are stored.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
  In Ruby a class is a category of things that are represented in code. A class is a combination of state and methods. 
  An object is everything you manipulate and the results of those manipulations.
  So, objects are instances of classes which are themselves objects.

4. What is a String?
  A string is a sequence of charaters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
  There are more than a hundred methods in the String class. Three listed from the text are
    String#split - break a line into fields
    String#scan - convert time from mm:ss to seconds
    String#chomp - removes newline character

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
  1 - with single quotes 'this is a string'
  2 - with double quotes "this is a string"
  difference - use double quotes for string interpolation (for when you want to imbed a variable in the string) and for greater character subsitution options.
