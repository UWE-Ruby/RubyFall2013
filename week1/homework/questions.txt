1. What is an object?
a instance of a class.

a reference to a object

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
a class is a combination of state and methods. an object is a instance of that class ( class instance ).  


4. What is a String?
A sequence of characters.  

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp, count, delete, empty? , length, upcase, downcase, split, squeeze! ... woah there are alot. 


6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?

single or double quotation marks. 

single quotes 'foo', foo becomes the value. 
For Double quotes, "foo\nbar" ruby looks for substitutions, interpolation "#{foo}" and escape sequences "Foo \nBar"

also %q ( single quotes ), %Q ( double quotes ) 

%q/foo bar/
%Q!oh no #{crap}!

you can choose a delimiter. 

Finally here documents. 

string = << HERE
	some kinda text 
	about something
	i forgot what
HERE
