1. What is an object?
	Everything in Ruby is an object.  An object is something that holds information and 
	has a value used to access the object.
	
2. What is a variable?
	A variable in  Ruby is not an object but a reference to an object.
	
3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
	An object is an instance of a class.  A class defines a thing.  An object is a thing.
	
4. What is a String?
	A sequence of (usually) printable characters. 
	
5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
	chomp - return a string with any trailing line return characters removed.
	capitalize - return a string with the first character capitalized and the remaining
	lowercase.
	length - return the number of characters in the string.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
	One way is to put a sequence of characters between single quotes, another way is to put
a sequence of characters between double quotes.  Double quotes support more escape
sequences.

Other ways of creating a string include using %q and a delimiter for a single-quoted
string or %Q and a delimiter for a double-quoted string.  The delimiter can be any 
non-alphanumeric, non-multibyte character.  If (, [ or < are used as the delimiter,
the string will be read until the next occurrence of the delimiter's closing counterpart.
