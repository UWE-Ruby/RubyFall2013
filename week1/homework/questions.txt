1. What is an object?
	An object is a class instance.
	It describes a real world item (it's state and actions)

2. What is a variable?
	A reference to an object

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
	An object is a particular instance of a class
		A rough example would be like saying that a class is like a form, while an object is when each person has fully filled that form out.

4. What is a String?
	A sequence of characters between delimiters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
	A String literal can be defined by single or double quotes.
	The difference in these is the amount of processing Ruby does. With double-quotes, Ruby does more work and supports more escaptes.
