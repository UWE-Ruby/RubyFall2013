Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object? Everything in Ruby is an object. Specifically in Ruby it is synonymous with class instance.

2. What is a variable? A variable is something that holds data. They hold a reference to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class? The class is the category. The object is the class instance.
Every object is generated from a class.

4. What is a String? Any text surrounded by single or double quotes, or, to put another way, sequences of characters
between delimiters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods Are you just looking for string
methods? .index, .reverse, .upcase, .downcase, .swapcase, .split and many more.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two? Text between single quotes
and text between double quotes. Uh, the quotes. Ruby does more work with the double quotes, such as looking for things that 
start with a \, and expression interpolation.
