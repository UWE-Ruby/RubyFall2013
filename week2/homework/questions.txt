Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
Arrays use intergers as keys/indexes, Hashes can use almost anything (strings, expressions, symbols, etc).

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Arrays are better for looping through and performing operations on all items. Hashes are better for storing data when you know the exact key/value you are looking for.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a wrapper for functionality. It allows for methods and classes to be contain within an easily integratable package.

Enumerable module adds support for methods like each_with_index, inject and map.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, but through the use of modules and the mixin facility you can inherit from multiple sources.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Modules represent a group of functionality; classes represent an object
Modules are inherited using the include feature of the mixin facility; classes use the extend feature.
Module's methods are accessed directly or included in a class; classes use the .new method
