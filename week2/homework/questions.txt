Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is integer indexed collection of objects. 
	array_example[0]  is the first object in the array.

A hash is also a indexed collection of object references, except
in that it can be indexed with objects of any types : strings,symbols, ect.. integers also.
but arrays are just indexed by integers. 

my_hash = { 'black' => 'knight' }

black (key) referes to knight ( value )

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

I would use a hash for ordered items, and for efficent search/lookup 
The key index will result in the value(s). Also to count frequencys. Using they 
key and incrementing the value as the key was counted. 

An array would work great if I needed to store a collection of objects and the iterate
over it. If I needed a que or a stack i'd use a array. Or if i needed to split a string,
or read in variable input to a method.

3. What is a module? 
a way of grouping together methods, classes and constants. Modules define a namespace.

Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Its a mixin. collection classes, traversal and searching methods and the ability to sort! 

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, Ruby is a single inheritance language. The child can only inherit from the parent. 
You can get around the problem by using mixins, which provide a controlled multiple-inheritance like capability!

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
a module can not be instantiated and a class can.
