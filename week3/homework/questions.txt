1. What is a symbol?
It is an identifier, representing a unique name for an object.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A symbol represents a single memory location in each instance that it is called, whereas there can be multiple instances of identical strings.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
It is a snipet of code that can be used. It can be used inline as {block here} or:
blah.blah do
  block here
end

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
It can be passed to a method with a yield statement (which may return a value to the block to be executed)

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
It is useable in logic operators with the =~ because it returns nil (which is falsy) if no match is found. Also, can be used to manipulate strings based on complicated criteria.
