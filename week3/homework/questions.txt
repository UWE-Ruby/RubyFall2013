1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is an object used  to represent names and strings in the Ruby interpreter.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Unlike strings, symbols are immutable.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code that can be associated with method invocations.
I call a block using curly brackets ({}) or by writing between "do" and "end".

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You can pass a block to a method using the "yield" statement in the method definition, and with the block appended to the method call.
The method signature is its name and the names and default values of its arguments.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
I would use regular expressions for processing text or search patterns for instance.
