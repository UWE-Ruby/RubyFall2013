1. What is a symbol?
A named identifier corresponding to a number of characters.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Symbols are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after assignment.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is any chunk of code between “do” and “end” (or curly brackets) that’s callable elsewhere.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
When defining a method, use an ampersand to assign a block to a variable.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
A regular expression is used to discover and match patterns within strings.
