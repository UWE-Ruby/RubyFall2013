1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is something used to correspond to a 
string of characters, often a name. 

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Symbols of the same name are initialized and exist in
memory only once during a session of Ruby. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code enclosed between either braces
or the keywords 'do' and 'end'. A block is invoked by 
a Ruby iterator; it may only appear in the source adjacent 
to a method call; the block is written starting on the 
same line as the method's last parameter.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
A block is passed to a method when a yield statement is 
executed. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions would be used in tests to see whether
strings match a desired pattern, extract parts of code 
that match the desired pattern, or find and replace
patterns in given strings with a desired set of characers.
