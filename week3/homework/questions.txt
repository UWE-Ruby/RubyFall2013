1. What is a symbol?
An identifier that represents a unique name for an object

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Symbols are unique constants, so they cannot be changed. New instances of a symbol refers to the same object. Strings can be changed, and new instances make a new object.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
Code that is basically a method that can be passed to iterators and enumerators. The iterator or enumerator then runs the code for each item in the array/hash. Blocks can be called after a method that accepts a block (such as an enumerator method). You must wrap the block braces or inbetween do/end.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
Object.each â€‹{|value| code to run }
or
Object.each do |value|
  code to run
end

Method signature is the variable(s) being passed to the block (whatever is inbetween the pipes).

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
When you need to find a series of characters within a string.
