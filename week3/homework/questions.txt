1. What is a symbol?

A symbol is a named identifier. It corresponds to a string of characters. A symbol will have the same memory address regardless of when and where it is called during execution of your program.

You can use a symbol anytime in your program, and don't need to predeclare it. There is no initialization -- Symbol does not respond to #new.

You would use a symbol where the value doesn't matter, but uniqueness does. Like the book's exapmle of compass directions. There's no need to have WEST = 1, or EAST = 223. All we want is the direction. (I suppose that you could make a case for west being 270 and east being 90, though).




2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

A symbol exists at a fixed location in memory regardless of when you call it during program execution. A string's address will change every time you make a new string.

10.times { puts "yodel".object_id }  # always different
10.times { puts :"yodel".object_id } # always same
10.times { puts :yodel.object_id }   # always same (identical to above)




3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

A block is a callable chunk of code that you can pass around as a parameter. A block is surrounded by curly braces or a do-end. Indisde the method, you invoke the block with the yield statement. A block will return the last executed method's return value, and you can capture that value inside your method definition. price = yield, for example.




4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

Put the block at the end of all the other parameters when calling a method. If you put an ampersand before the last variable in the method's argument list, that block will be turned into a Proc object that you can store it--perhaps as an instance variable--and call later.

def da_bears(ditka, &da_block)
    res = da_block.yield
    puts "Da Bears win #{res}-0"

    if ditka
        puts "ditka rules"
    end
end

da_bears(true) { 20 }




5. Where would you use regular expressions?

You use regular expressions when you want to discover and manipulate certain patterns in strings.
