1. What is a symbol?
Symbols are constants that don't have to be declared or given value. They are often given as keys for hashes.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string represents the characters it contains and has a number of functions that can be applied to it. If it is used in a variable or constant, it must be declared and saved/assigned. A symbol does not have to be declared or assigned, and can't be searched through or changed like a string.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
Blocks are pieces of code meant to be iterated multiple times on another piece of code. To call, you need to give the block arguments and to surround it with {} (usually if single-line) or do/end (usually multi-line).

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
To pass a block to a method, the method is called with a block and whenever the keyword "yield" occurs, the block will be run.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Regular expressions are used to match parts of strings to certain patterns. These patterns can be specific words, symbols, or user-defined types of strings (e.g. searching for something that looks like an email address by looking for text followed by @ followed by text, a ., and a bit more text.)
