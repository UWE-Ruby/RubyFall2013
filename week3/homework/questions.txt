  A symbol cannot be changed.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
  A block is a set of code that you pass to a method. Call those code in the method definition with the 'yield' keyword.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
  Put the block after the arguments in a do;end block or in between curly brackets.
  The method signature is the way a method is set to accept arguments and blocks.
