1. What is a symbol? Symbols represent names and some strings inside the Ruby interpreter.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string? Symbols are similar to strings, but with the key difference that symbols are immutable. They cannot be changed after assignment, whereas strings can be overwritten. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block? Blocks are chunks of code between curly braces or do-end. They can be called via block.call. A method can call a block using the yield statement.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature? Via the yield statement. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions? When you wish to test a string to see whether it matches a pattern, when you want to extract from a string the sections that match all or part of a pattern, or when you want to change a string, replacing parts that match a pattern.
