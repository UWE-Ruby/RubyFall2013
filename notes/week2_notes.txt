JRuby - converts ruby code into java code

MRI == CRuby

respond_to?
what messages does the object respond to?
* method calls or properties

rather than checking the type, check to see if it 
responds to the message you are sending it

^this is the principle of duck typing

sudo gem install grb

simplies working with remote branches

"Hello world".respond_to? "+"

.inspect

%q(hello world)
%Q(hello world)

ruby inherits smalltalk's thinking in that
it treats methods as messages that are responded to.

a # sign in front of a method in the docs indicates it is an instance
:: in the docs indicates a class method

"hello".send("size")
"hello".size

"hello".send("+", "world")

my_name.chop!

.object_id

my_name = "Hello"
other_name = my_name
my_name = "Hello World"
puts other_name
# prints "Hello" and NOT "Hello World"
# because other_name is pointing to the
# original "Hello" string literal object
