Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?
The method_messing is used when an object executes the method, but the method is not found. It is ran instead of a NoMethodError exception. The method_missing method is passed the symbol of the non-existent method, an array of the arguments that were passed in the original call and any block passed to the original method.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?
An Eigenclass is the anonymous class that is created when you define a Singleton method on an object. It is used to hold the new method and the original class as the superclass.Singleton methods live inside this Eigenclass

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
I would use DuckTypeing when working in dynamic languages that do not have strong typing (Ruby, Javascript, etc). I would use to make my code more flexable and futureproof.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
Class methods are ran on the class themselves while instances methods are ran on that particular instance. If you create a new instance of a class the class method will not work. Attempting to run a class method on an instance will also not work. A class method is for anything that does not deal with an individual instance of a class. instance_eval is used to dfine a class method while class_eval is used ot define an instance method.

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
A singleton class effects all instances of that class, a singleton method only effects the single instance.
