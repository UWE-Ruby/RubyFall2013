Questions:

1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?

This is called when instance doesn't respond to a method and all of its superclasses also don't respond to the same method. method_missing is then called in the original class, and moves up its inheritance heirarchy until something responds. BaseObject does respond by throwing a method missing error.



2. What is an Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?

An Eigenclass is an anonymous class created when you add a method to a single instance of a class.The new class is a subclass of the instance's original class.



3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?

Duck typing makes it possible for programmers to not worry about what kind of object they are working with. Really, the more important questions is if an object responds to a particular method. So if your method takes a parameter and performs the << method on it, it doesn't matter what kind of object it is. All it has to do is respond to the << method. So you can interchange arrays and strings since they both respond to <<.



4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?

You call a class method on the class itself, not an object. Instance methods are called on instances of classes.

class_eval and instance_eval let you set self to an arbitrary object, evaluate code in a block, and then reset self.

class_eval sets up the context of inside the body of a class definition. So you can add instance methods to a class by calling class_eval on a class and defining a new method inside of the block.

instance_eval can add class methods to a class by defining methods inside of the passed in block.



5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?

Singleton methods are methods that are available to only a single instance of a class. When you add a singleton method to an object, a singleton anonymous class is inserted into the receiver's inheritance strucuture.
